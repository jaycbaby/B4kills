D3 Data Visualization- Battlefield 4 stats
=======

Pulling player stats from unofficial Battlefield 4 database to allow players to visualize their (or their friends') kill distribution.

3 zoomable layers of visualization: 
- kills favoring either weapons or vehicles
- weapon class (snipers, LMGs, assault) or vehicle category (helicopter, boat)
- specific weapons (AK-47, M-60) or vehicles (AC-130 Gunship)
